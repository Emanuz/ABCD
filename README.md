Chinese Dialect Audio Bible Repository through crowd sourcing 

What is CDAB?

I am proposing Chinese Dialect Audio Bible Repository.


Why CDAB?

Chinese Bible was printed in Traditional and Simplified character, but it can be read with Putonghua/Mandarin or different dialects, e.g. Cantonese, Taiwanese with different degree of understanding.
There are people do not have the priviledge to learn to read and write standardize Chinese, but there are many are not able to read but they can or they prefer to listen to the Bible in their heart language -- mother tongue.

The repository can also be a good source for other to learn different langauges.

This can provide the audio source text for translation to other langauges.

This is a good way to engage, promote scriptural engagement and the awareness of the diversity of the langauges in the global village.

The methodology can be used for context beyond Chinese, those audio data and corpus can help with future linguistic and especially socio-linguistic research. There can be other academic domain may find those data helpful.

How CDAB?

Who can participate?

Plan and question and brainstorming:

1. Where can we put the audio data of the dialect?
2. How can we get the audio files?
3. What portion of the Bible suggest to start?
4. What Chinese version are available for volunteer to read?
